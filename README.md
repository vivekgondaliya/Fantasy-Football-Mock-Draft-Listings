# Fantasy-Football-Mock-Draft-Listings
If you are used to Mock Drafts than you know that when the mock draft is finished, 
you will get the draft summary on round basis to your email.

Problem [--mockDraft.txt--]: It contains every one's picks on round by round basis. Doesn't summarize you picks in one section.

Code result [--myMockDraft.txt--]: Gives you a list of your picks only using pattern pattern match or simple String equal().
